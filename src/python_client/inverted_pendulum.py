# INVERTED PENDULUM DEMO
# This is included as the simplest yet most perverse example I could think of for a learnable, highly non-convex control problem.
# The demo is comprised of a double inverted pendulum simulation, which receives control input from a neural network.

# That the system successfully learns to control this system reasonably well is a powerful 
# demonstration of the general applicability of simple evolutionary search algorithms.
